    <h3>SOFTWARE ENGINEER - FRONT END</h3>
    <P>Hi, I'm Sieva -- a software engineer with a passion for clean code, problem-solving, and building things that make life a little easier. <br>

        After spending several years working in web development and backend systems, I took a two-year break to explore other interests and focus <br> on personal growth. During that time, I gained new perspectives that I am now bringing back into my coding journey. <br>
        
        I'm currently re-learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with fresh eyes and renewed enthusiasm.Rebuilding my technical foundation is both <br> exciting and humbling, and I'm sharing this journey through small projects as I re-ignite my love for software development.
    </P>
